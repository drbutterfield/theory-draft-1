*Inquiry-Based Music Theory* is an [open-source]({{ site.github-repo }}), interactive, online textbook for college-level music theory courses.
It was developed with support of the [Think Open Fellowship](https://open.lib.uidaho.edu/) to teach courses at University of Idaho. 
The project was inspired by and partially adapted from [*Open Music Theory*](http://openmusictheory.com/).

Each chapter represents one week in the course, and is split into topics. 
Each topic has Overview, Examples, and Lesson sections.
All content can be found in the side bar navigation or [table of contents]({{ site.baseurl}}/toc.html).
