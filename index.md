title: Inquiry-Based Music Theory
---

*Inquiry-Based Music Theory* is an [open-source]({{site.github-repo }}), interactive, online textbook for college-level music theory courses written and designed by Sean Butterfield and Evan Williamson.
It was developed with support of the [Think Open Fellowship](https://open.lib.uidaho.edu/) from the University of Idaho. 
The project was inspired by and partially adapted from [*Open Music Theory*](http://openmusictheory.com/).

The textbook is designed to maximize flexibility and support an inquiry-based model of instruction. For a simple explanation of this model as well as how to best utilize this textbook's structure, please view:
