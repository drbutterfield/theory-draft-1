###Browser compatability

We recommend that you use either Chrome or Firefox when using this website because of our ABC Editor for rendering all musical examples. Safari is capable or rendering the music but will not be able to use the MIDI playback function. This also means that iPhones will not be able to use the MIDI playback either, because they force all browsers, including Chrome and Firefox, to use Safari's infrastructure. 

### Current Known Technical Issues

Actions that may lock the module and require a refresh:
- Creating a blank line
- Multiple rapid changes without allowing time for rendering
Fix: 
- If you do not want to keep your changes, simply hit the 'Reset' button to reload the editor. 
- If you would like to save any changes that you have made:
    - Place your cursor in the editor's textbox
    - Select all the text (Ctrl-A on PC, Command-A on Macs)
    - Copy the text (Ctrl-C on PC, Command-C on Macs)
    - Press the 'Reset' button below the editor box
    - Select all of the text again (Ctrl-A on PC, Command-A on Macs)
    - Paste your old text on top of the new text (Ctrl-V on PC, Command-A on Macs)
